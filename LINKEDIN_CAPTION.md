## Version 2 - Impact-Focused

📝 Solving a real problem for the academic community!

Just launched **HTML Citation Cleaner** - a web tool that removes citation markers from HTML content while keeping everything else intact (including complex LaTeX formulas!)

🎓 **Why I built this:**
Working with academic content, I noticed citations like [cite: 124, 125] and [cite_start] cluttered HTML files. Manual removal? Time-consuming and error-prone. So I automated it!

✨ **What makes it special:**
• Two-step intelligent cleaning algorithm
• Live preview - see changes before downloading
• LaTeX support - perfect for STEM content
• Zero data loss - structure stays 100% intact
• 6 copy methods - choose what works for you

🚀 **Deployment Journey:**
Went from local development to production in hours using:
• FastAPI for lightning-fast backend
• Azure Free Tier for global reach (Central India region)
• GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD
• Modern UI with glass morphism design

The best part? It's completely FREE to use and open-source! 🎉

## Version 3 - Quick & Catchy

AI broke it. I fixed it. In 1 hour. 🚀

Using Google Gemini to generate HTML? Great!  
Gemini adding [cite: 124] everywhere? Not great! 😤

Tried:
❌ Ctrl+F manual cleanup - took forever  
❌ Asked Gemini to fix it - gave solutions instead of clean code  
✅ Built my own tool - 1 HOUR!

**HTML Citation Cleaner** - Now LIVE on Azure!

🎯 What it does: Removes citation markers, preserves structure + LaTeX
⚡ Stack: FastAPI + Python + Azure
🌐 Status: https://html-citation-cleaner-3841.azurewebsites.net

When AI creates the problem, sometimes YOU are the solution! 💡

## Version 4 - Story-Based (RECOMMENDED - Your Personal Journey)

When AI becomes the problem AND the solution! 🤖➡️💡

**My Story:**

I was using Google Gemini to generate HTML blocks for my study materials. Great tool, but there was ONE annoying problem - it kept adding citation markers like [cite: 124, 125] and [cite_start] everywhere! 😤

**First attempt:** Manual cleanup using Ctrl+F  
Result: Hours wasted. Repetitive. Error-prone. Frustrated. ❌

**Then I had an idea:** What if I paste the Gemini-generated HTML back to Gemini and ask it to remove citations?  
Result: Gemini gave me SOLUTIONS and explanations instead of just cleaning the code! 🤦‍♂️

**Final solution:** Build it myself!  
Time taken: Just 1 HOUR! ⚡

🚀 **HTML Citation Cleaner** is now LIVE!

Here's what happened in that ONE hour:
1️⃣ Built FastAPI backend with intelligent 2-step cleaning algorithm
2️⃣ Created responsive UI with live preview
3️⃣ Added MathJax support (because my HTML had LaTeX formulas!)
4️⃣ Deployed to Azure (and it worked first try!)
5️⃣ Made it open-source for everyone facing the same issue

💡 **The Irony:**
• Problem: Created by AI (Gemini adding citations)
• Failed Solution: Asking AI to fix it (Gemini giving explanations)
• Real Solution: Building my own tool in 1 hour!

✨ **Features I added:**
• Paste OR upload HTML
• Live before/after preview
• LaTeX formula preservation
• 6 different copy methods
• Real-time statistics
• Glass morphism UI (because why not!)

📊 **Results:**
✅ Saves hours of manual work
✅ 100% accuracy - no structure damage
✅ Handles 100KB+ files in milliseconds
✅ Now deployed on Azure Free Tier

**Lesson learned:** Sometimes the fastest solution is to build it yourself! When you know exactly what you need, coding is faster than searching for workarounds.

## Best Practices for LinkedIn Post:

1. **Add a screenshot/video** of the app in action
2. **Tag relevant people/companies**: @Microsoft Azure, @FastAPI, etc.
3. **Use 3-5 hashtags** (max 30, but 3-5 performs better)
4. **Post timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 AM or 12-2 PM
5. **Engage**: Respond to all comments within first hour
6. **Consider**: Create a short demo video (30-60 sec)
7. **Follow-up**: Share metrics after 1 week (users, deploys, stars)

## Recommended Media:
- Screenshot of the live preview feature
- GIF showing paste → clean → copy workflow
- Before/after comparison image
- Architecture diagram (optional)
