## Version 2 - Impact-Focused

📝 Solving a real problem for the academic community!

Just launched **HTML Citation Cleaner** - a web tool that removes citation markers from HTML content while keeping everything else intact (including complex LaTeX formulas!)

🎓 **Why I built this:**
Working with academic content, I noticed citations like [cite: 124, 125] and [cite_start] cluttered HTML files. Manual removal? Time-consuming and error-prone. So I automated it!

✨ **What makes it special:**
• Two-step intelligent cleaning algorithm
• Live preview - see changes before downloading
• LaTeX support - perfect for STEM content
• Zero data loss - structure stays 100% intact
• 6 copy methods - choose what works for you

🚀 **Deployment Journey:**
Went from local development to production in hours using:
• FastAPI for lightning-fast backend
• Azure Free Tier for global reach (Central India region)
• GitHub Actions for seamless CI/CD
• Modern UI with glass morphism design

The best part? It's completely FREE to use and open-source! 🎉

## Best Practices for LinkedIn Post:

1. **Add a screenshot/video** of the app in action
2. **Tag relevant people/companies**: @Microsoft Azure, @FastAPI, etc.
3. **Use 3-5 hashtags** (max 30, but 3-5 performs better)
4. **Post timing**: Tuesday-Thursday, 7-9 AM or 12-2 PM
5. **Engage**: Respond to all comments within first hour
6. **Consider**: Create a short demo video (30-60 sec)
7. **Follow-up**: Share metrics after 1 week (users, deploys, stars)

## Recommended Media:
- Screenshot of the live preview feature
- GIF showing paste → clean → copy workflow
- Before/after comparison image
